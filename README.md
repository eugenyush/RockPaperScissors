# RockPaperScissors - A Simple Game

**RockPaperScissors** is a simple web application that allows users to play the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game against a computer opponent. The game randomly selects a move for the computer and compares it with the player's choice to determine the winner.

It is built using:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

## ðŸ‘¾ Features

- Play the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game.
- Random move selection for the computer.
- Score tracking to keep track of the player's and computer's wins.
- Simple and intuitive interface with clean design.

## ðŸ“’ Process

I started by building the basic game logic using JavaScript to handle the random selection of moves for the computer and comparing them with the player's choice. Next, I designed a simple UI with HTML and CSS to provide a visual representation of the game.

Additional features include score tracking, which allows the player to see how many rounds they've won or lost.

**NOTE:** This is a simple game project designed to demonstrate basic JavaScript functionality and DOM manipulation.
